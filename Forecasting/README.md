# Experiment for geopotential height forecasting

To reproduce results (for one member of the ensemble) in our [manuscript](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2021-415/gmd-2021-415.pdf) - first download data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTZ8dfsM-OIZ8JT5DZXfboJZkAI6nf8h/view?usp=sharing) and extract the contents of that archive to this folder.

Subsequently - you can run the experiment using
```
python source/main.py
python source/comparisons.py
```

### Note
Running the forecast overwrites prior results so please save `results/Paper_test_III/` to a backup.
