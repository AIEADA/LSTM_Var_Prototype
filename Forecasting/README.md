To reproduce results (for one member of the ensemble) in our [manuscript](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2021-415/gmd-2021-415.pdf) - first download data from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTZ8dfsM-OIZ8JT5DZXfboJZkAI6nf8h/view?usp=sharing)

Subsequently - you can run the experiment using
